## About Me

I am a final year Computer Science student at the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen ([CUHK-Shenzhen](https://cuhk.edu.cn/)). I was an exchange [tar heel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_Heel) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in Year 2024-25.

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer security, machine learning, and hardware security. I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Yue Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6TMdWj8AAAAJ) and [Prof. Yunming Xiao](https://yunmingxiao.github.io/) at CUHK Shenzhen. In the summer of 2025, I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Ning Zhang](https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Ning-Zhang.html) at Washington University in St. Louis.
