## About Me

I am a B.Eng student in Computer Science Engineering at the School of Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. I am currently on an exchange program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I am pursuing graduate-level coursework in security, machine learning, and computer vision.

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer security, machine learning, and hardware security. I focus on developing novel techniques to protect intellectual property of deep learning models, detecting jailbreak attacks on vision-language models, and understanding hardware-based security primitives.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Security:** Hardware security, side-channel attacks, trusted execution environments
- **Machine Learning Security:** Jailbreak detection, adversarial robustness, IP protection for deep learning models
- **Computer Vision:** 3D computer vision, neural network verification, efficient deep learning
